    <h1>Junior Rails Programmer</h1>
    <h2>Do I "Shape-Up"?</h2>

    <section>
      <h3>üß© Problem</h3>
      <p>
        Most junior roles look for grads with 3+ years experience, youngsters
        that are raring to go and get stuck into their forever 9-5 ASAP careers.
        <br />
        <br />That's not me. I am not a grad, and I'm very much not a junior
        (80's kid alert!)... <br /><br />I'm a curious, life-long learner,
        attempting a career switch after falling for coding while embarking on a
        new hobby. <br />
        Shaped by the first tastes of online socialising and coping with dial
        up, feeling like a hacker with limewire and the sounds from Greenhill
        Zone permanently etched in my brain, growing up in the 90's made me who
        I am today. I've lived a few lives already ‚Äî across countries and
        careers ‚Äî and everything led me here. So yeah, maybe I‚Äôm the ‚Äúproblem‚Äù
        the hiring filters don't usually favour.

      <h3>üç∞ Appetite</h3>
      <p>
        I'm in this for the long haul, for the opportunity not only to learn,
        grow and to feed my personal sense of accomplishment but to be part of a
        team that is building something great. <br /><br />
        Away from corporate fluff, office drama and disconnected leadership.
