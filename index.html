      <h3>Problem</h3>
      <p>
        Me! Hi, I'm the problem it's me! <br />
        I refuse to believe it, surely not. <br />
        Most junior roles look for grads with 3+ years experience, youngsters
        that are raring to go and get stuck into their forever 9-5 ASAP careers.
        <br />
        <br />That's not me. I am not a grad, and I'm very much not a junior
        (80's kid alert!)... <br /><br />I'm a curious, life-long learner,
        attempting a career switch after falling for coding after embarking on a
        new hobby. <br />
        Shaped by the first tastes of online socialising and coping with dial
        up, feeling like a hacker with limewire and the sounds from Greenhill
        Zone permanently etched in my brain, growing up in the 90's made me who
        I am today. A career-switcher, a curious soul who has lived a few lives
        already — across countries and careers — and everything led me here. So
        yeah, maybe I’m the “problem” the hiring filters don't usually favour.
        <br /><br />
        But 37Signals is different.

      <h3>Appetite</h3>
      <p>
        I'm in this for the long haul, for the opportunities not only to learn,
        grow and to feed my personal sense of accomplishment but to be part of a
        team that is building something great. <br /><br />
        Away from corporate fluff, office drama and disconnected leadership.
        <br />
